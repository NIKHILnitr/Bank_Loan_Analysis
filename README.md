**1. Introduction:**

The goal of this project is to gain actionable insights from financial loan data to inform decision-making processes. By leveraging SQL queries to extract and manipulate data, followed by visualizations created in Power BI, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential risks associated with the loans.

**2. Dataset Description:**

The dataset contains several tables, including:

- **Borrowers:** Information about loan applicants, such as name, age, and employment status.
- **Loans:** Details of individual loans, including loan amount, interest rate, and term.
- **Repayments:** Records of loan repayments, including dates and amounts paid.
- **Financial Metrics:** Additional financial metrics related to loans, such as debt-to-income ratio and credit score.

**3. Technologies Used:**

- SQL: Used for querying and analyzing the dataset.
- Power BI: Employed for data visualization and dashboard creation.

**4. Installation Instructions:**

To replicate this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any preferred SQL database management tool.
- Power BI Desktop.

Once installed, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset and load it into your SQL database.
2. Open the SQL queries provided in the project to perform data analysis.
3. Connect Power BI to your SQL database and import the necessary tables.
4. Create visualizations and dashboards in Power BI based on the analysis.

**5. SQL Queries:**

The SQL queries included in this project are designed to extract and manipulate data to derive meaningful insights. They cover various aspects of loan analysis, including:

- Loan performance metrics.
- Borrower demographics.
- Trend analysis over time.
- Risk assessment.

**6. Power BI Visualization:**

The Power BI dashboard provides an intuitive interface to explore and visualize the loan data. Key visualizations include:

- Loan portfolio composition.
- Loan performance metrics (e.g., default rates, repayment trends).
- Borrower demographics analysis.
- Geographic distribution of loans.

**7. Conclusion:**

Through the combined use of SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project offers valuable insights into the financial loan portfolio. Further analysis and refinement of the dashboard may provide additional insights and opportunities for optimization in loan management strategies.
